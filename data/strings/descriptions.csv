unscaa_longsword,SHIP,"A Longsword equipped with tools to allow strategic-scale coordination with an attached strikecraft wing. A venerable, reliable, and versatile strikecraft, the GA-TL1 Longsword has served the UNSC for an impressively long time if public records are to say anything. Compartively huge to the rest of the Sector's strikecraft, its large size and bulk allows excellent survivability and numerous loadout options. For now, however, the UNSC remains content to kit the Longsword as strategic bombers, preferring the YSS-100 Sabre for fighter and interceptor duties.",,,
unscaa_sabre,SHIP,"A Sabre equipped with tools to allow strategic-scale coordination with an attached strikecraft wing. Orignally a dead project, the UNSC revived it from surviving records and data in order to alleviate the workload on the Longsword strikecraft. Fast, manuverable, and well-armored the YSS-100 Sabre is best described as the UNSC's counterpart to the ubtiquitous Broadsword fighters, although significantly more durable and deadlier. The Sabre fulfills the fighter and interceptor roles in the UNSC naval doctrine.",,,
unsc_pelican,SHIP,"A longtime veteran among the UNSC's service vehicles, the D-77 Tactical Aerospace Lifter colloquially known as the ""Pelican"" is the premiere workhorse of the UNSC's logistical network. Capable of ferrying cargo, troops, and ground vehicles the Pelican is an one-size-fits-all when it comes to jobs like moving people or materials between point A and B. While meant for ground operations, the D-77H-TC can adequetely support strikecraft operations with the ANVIL-II pods and spare wing-mounted hardpoints.",,,
unscaa_pelican,SHIP,"A Pelican gunship curiously equipped with tools that allow strategic-scale coordination with an attached strikecraft wing. While the UNSC normally doesn't deploy the Pelican as a combatant in operations, its ability to carry various payloads and weapons allows it to punch above its weight, as well as support other elements within the battlefield. In groundside operations, a Pelican providing gunship support is a welcomed sight for friendly forces.",,,
unsc_vulture,SHIP,"The AC-220 Vulture is a ponderous and bulky brick of armor, engine, and weapons. Designed to support ground operations and siege fortified locations, this imposing aircraft was never meant to be deployed in space for long periods of time, lacking the necessary radiation shielding present in other strikecraft. In the Sector, however, the UNSC thought it would be prudent to produce space-capable versions of the Vulture to provide extra firepower for logistical and patrol elements, as well maintain a upper hand in spaceborne operations like the invasion of a space station or barren planetoid.",,,
unscaa_vulture,SHIP,"A Vulture oddly equipped with tools that allow strategic-scale coordination with an attached strikecraft wing. While its lack of speed and agility hinders the Vulture in combat, its arsenal more than makes up for it. With two long-range missile launchers capable of picking off opposing strikecraft and missiles, vertically launched ANVIL-IVs can pose a threat to even cruisers and capitals, and a total of four rotary autocannons that can shred through armor like a woodchipper, a Vulture should not be underestimate even in space combat.",,,

#unsc_pelicangs,SHIP,"A D-77H retrofitted into a proper gunship, the -GS variant uparmors the Pelican and boosts it shield for better survivability, in addition to bolstering its offensive capabilities. While it comes at the cost of speed and manuverability, the swap to a heavier nosegun and additional missiles allow the Pelican gunship to better support ground operations and fight in strikecraft operations.",,,

#weapons,,,,,
pelicanmsl,WEAPON,"The ANVIL-II Air-to-Surface missile is a common sight on the D-77 Pelican, allowing the troop carrier to clear landing zones or strike targets that pose a threat to the ground pounders below. While not spectacular in space combat, it is serviceable and better than nothing.",,,
pelicangun,WEAPON,"The M370 autocannon, commonly nicknamed the ""Pelican Gun"" by the enlisted, is an anti-personnel and anti-vehicle weapon employed as the D-77's primary nose gun. While not accurate, the weapon is reliable and effective even in space. ",,,
unsc_pelicanbomb,WEAPON,"An ASGM-10 modified with a solid warhead and an EMP payload. With the prevalence of shields among the Sector's ships, the UNSC developed a variant of the ASGM-10 to instead overload shielded vessels, or, if no shields are present, knock out weapons and systems on a ship with its EMP payload. With a focus on direct kinetic energy, the missile engines are significantly stronger at the cost of reduced turning.",,,
vultureac,WEAPON,"A pair of GAU-24 autocannons, these tri-barrelled rotary guns allow the Vulture gunship to lay down tremendous quantities of explosive bullets onto its targets. Unsurprisingly, these weapons are inaccurate and thus require aiming software and close-range circumstances to allow better accuracy and precision.",,,
vulturemsl_vl,WEAPON,"The A-74 Sylver Vertical Missile Launcher system comes loaded with ANVIL-IVs A2S missiles, the more deadlier and larger brother to the ANVIL-IIs. Designed to collapse fortified positions and heavy ground armor, the ANVIL-IV is more than up to the task of stripping armor of space vessels and tearing hulls apart.",,,
vulturemsl,WEAPON,"The Argent V missile, titled the ASGM-2 on documents, are missiles designed for anti-aircraft work, though its service history has seen it used as a general purpose weapon. These missiles give the Vulture a strong fighting chance against attacking strikecraft, as well providing a tool to suppress point defense arrays and shields",,,
